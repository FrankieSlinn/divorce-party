- ### FLOW CHART, USER STORIES AND WIREFRAME

The design was done in a meeting with all the members of the team. 
User stories, wireframes, a schema containing the models and a flowchart were produced during this session. These were consolidated into a README document.

This was  were provided to the tutors who reviewed these and approved the project. 


## PLANNING

The team met for half a day to align on the project concept, a schedule and coding approach. 

Decisions were made around the team name "Chewing the Crud" and on what type of app would be built, the Divorce Party Comments Book. 

Areas like the team members' strengths and weaknesses and values were discussed. 
This was captured within a Team Expectations Document stored on the team's shared drive. It was later shared with the course tutors.

## BUILD/CODE PROCESS

The project utilised the MERN Stack. As a first step a connection with the Mongo Database was established. A seed file was then produced to populate initial data into the database. 

Models were then established for the Users and Posts. Once the models were completed backend routes were coded. The routes were tested in Postman API Platform. 

After the backend routes were successfully tested the frontend routes were implemented.

The user authentication was developed using bcrypt for password hashing and Passport JWT for user authentication.  The authentication was integrated into the routes.

Github provided version control. To minimise merge conflicts commits and pulls were done frequently.
