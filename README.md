# PROJECT 3
# THE DIVORCE PARTY GUEST BOOK
# By Chewing the CRUD

## DESCRIPTION
A MERN Full-Stack Website that allows users to sign-up for an account, read, post, edit and delete comments in a Divorce Party Guest Book. This was implemented as a group project consisting of four General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive students with the amusing team name "Chewing the CRUD".  


## WHY A DIVORCE PARTY GUESTBOOK? 
Lots of people will attest to their experience of divorce as one of the best things that ever happened to them. Of course they will want to celebrate with lots of friends and family. What better way to commemorate the celebration than with a Divorce Party Guestbook? The app was developed to help recent divorcees enjoy their divorce party to the fullest and will hopefully let users re-live all the happy memories. A divorce isn't the end; merely the beginning to either a new chapter or a whole new sequel.

    - Deploy the back-end via Heroku (or vercel).
    - Deploy the MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas.


## GETTING STARTED/CODE INSTALLATION

  - To begin with a GitHub Repository called **project3-mernstack-app** was set up that was cloned by all the team members. 
  - A number of packages needed to be installed in the code as dependencies in both the front-end and back-end directories. To make the process as neat as possible (and primarily to avoid GitHub merge conflicts) it was decided that one person would do the package installations relevant to their bit of coding and then everyone else would run a `git pull` command in their command-line interface (CLI) terminal. This would merge the *package-json* dependencies to everyone's code and then each member could run an `npm install` command in their own CLI terminal.  
  - We all used Visual Studio as a code editor. Initially, two team members (Franziska and Hari) tried to use VS Code's **Live Share** feature to programme as a pair, but confusion relating to merge conflicts resulted in its prompt abandonment.

## TIMEFRAME & WORKING TEAM

- We were given 8 days to work on this project and our team of 4 members comprised of:
  - Benjamin Khoury
  - Franziska Kissling
  - Hari Ramanathan (GitHub Code Owner/Team Lead)
  - Katie Loesch

## PLANNING

The team brainstormed for half of Day 1 to develop the project concept, design, coding approach and working schedule.

We decided on the team name and website theme almost immediately. We discussed each team members' strengths and weaknesses and our team values. You can view this here: [Team Expectations Setting Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QG9nAynGNKvsSN4Jzfesn4T-DbXv5GxTEtXh-bZMAAM/edit).

- ### FLOW CHART, USER STORIES AND WIREFRAME

  As a team we devised the user stories, wireframes, schema and flowchart containing the database models to be used in our project. 

  **User Stories**
  - As a user I should be able to access the website from different devices/browsers.
  - As a user I should be able to register with a username and password.
  - As a user I should be able to login with my username and password.
  - As a user I should be able to view all posts.
  - As a user I should be able to view my posts.
  - As a user I should be able to write new posts.
  - As a user I should be able to delete my posts.
  - As a user I should be able to edit my posts.
  - As a user I should be able to log off from the website.

  **Wireframe**

  **Schema**

  **Database Models Flowchart**

- ### LAYOUT

  Franziska took the lead with researching a number of colour schemes online and as a team we agreed upon the first colour scheme below:
  ![Colour Schemes](./documentation/ColourSchemes.png "Colour Schemes")

  Franziska did the same with potential images to be used for the website. Again, as a team we went with the first one. (**WARNING**: One of the images contains a swear word.)
  ![Divorce Party Images](./documentation/DivorcePartyImages.png "Divorce Party Images")

  We used the **Tailwind CSS** framework for our layout and styling. We added the chosen colour scheme above to our Tailwind *config* file.

  This is what our final homepage layout looked like:
  ![Layout](./documentation/Layout.png "Layout")


## BUILD/CODE PROCESS

We utilised the MERN Stack. As a first step a connection with the Mongo Database was established. A seed file was then produced to populate initial data into the database. 

Models were then established for the Users and Posts. Once the models were completed backend routes were coded. The routes were tested in Postman API Platform. 

After the backend routes were successfully tested the frontend routes were implemented.

The user authentication was developed using bcrypt for password hashing and Passport JWT for user authentication.  The authentication was integrated into the routes.

Github provided version control. To minimise merge conflicts commits and pulls were done frequently. 


## CHALLENGES

- Seeding: The team faced challenges while implementing the seed file to populate initial data into the database. It required careful handling and synchronization to ensure the data was properly seeded.
- Authentication: Developing user authentication posed challenges. The team utilized bcrypt for password hashing and Passport JWT for user authentication. Integrating authentication into the routes required careful implementation and testing.


## WINS

- Authentication: Successfully implementing user authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and Passport JWT for user authentication was a significant win for the team. It ensured secure access and protected user data.
- Tailwind CSS: Utilizing the Tailwind CSS framework for layout and styling proved to be a success. The chosen color scheme and styling enhanced the overall design of the website.
- Git conflicts: The team effectively managed Git conflicts by frequently committing and pulling changes from the repository. This approach minimized conflicts and facilitated smooth collaboration.


## KEY LEARNING/TAKEAWAYS

- In the immortal words of Big Chris, *It's been emotional*.


## BUGS

- One notable challenge encountered at the end of the project was the issue with the Front-End deployment prep and its relation to the (back-end) Heroku server. This connectivity issue caused a disruption in the expected flow of data and functionality, hindering the full operation of the website. The team worked diligently to troubleshoot and resolve this bug, but were unable to do so. Hence the website is only accessible via a *localhost*.


## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- Create a file upload facility for user profile pictures and party pictures within a post: Enhancing the website by adding a file upload feature would allow users to upload profile pictures and images related to their divorce party posts, further enriching the user experience.
- Get quotes about divorce via an external API: Integrating an external API that provides quotes specifically related to divorce would add interesting and relevant content to the website. It could enhance the overall user engagement and provide additional value to the users.
